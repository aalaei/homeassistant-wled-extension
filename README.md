# **WLED Extension Integration for Home Assistant**

This custom integration extends the official [WLED integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wled/) by adding **missing or advanced WLED features** not yet available in the core component.  
Currently, it provides support for controlling **Audio Reactive Sync** functionality in WLED ‚Äî including simple entities to toggle between **Send**, **Receive**, and **Off** modes, and a switch to enable or disable the Audio Reactive feature entirely.

Future updates will continue to expand support for additional WLED extensions and advanced features.
